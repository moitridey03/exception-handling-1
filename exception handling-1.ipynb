    "In Python, an exception refers to an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing the exception is created, and the program's execution is halted. Exception handling in Python allows for the detection and resolution of such conditions, enabling the program to gracefully respond to errors and continue execution or terminate appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors lies in their nature and occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "They are typically caused by conditions such as invalid input, inappropriate usage of functions or objects, file handling errors, or system-related issues.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, FileNotFoundError, and IndexError.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using try, except, finally, and raise statements, allowing the program to respond to errors gracefully and continue execution.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing of code before execution.\n",
    "They are caused by violations of the language's syntax rules, such as misspelled keywords, missing or misplaced punctuation, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the interpreter from compiling or executing the code and must be corrected before the program can run.\n",
    "Common examples of syntax errors include missing colons in control flow statements, mismatched parentheses or brackets, and misspelled variable or function names.\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during program execution due to runtime conditions, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of code before execution due to violations of the language's syntax rules. Handling exceptions allows programs to gracefully respond to errors and continue execution, while syntax errors must be corrected before the program can run."
